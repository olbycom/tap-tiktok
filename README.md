# tap-tiktok

`tap-tiktok` is a Singer tap for TikTok.

Built with the [Meltano Tap SDK](https://sdk.meltano.com) for Singer Taps.

## Installation

```bash
pipx install git+https://github.com/gthsheep/tap-tiktok
```

## Configuration

### Accepted Config Options

`access_token` - Access Token for the API as obtained via the authentication process described below.  
`advertiser_id` - Advertiser ID for your TikTok account.  
`start_date` - Start date as of when to start collecting metrics, e.g. `2022-01-01T00:00:00Z`  

A full list of supported settings and capabilities for this
tap is available by running:

```bash
tap-tiktok --about
```

### Source Authentication and Authorization

To obtain an `access_token` you should follow the App creation steps described in the TikTok documentation,
[here](https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1701890912382977), then the Authentication documentation, 
[here](https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1701890914536450).  
As for scopes for your App, metrics streams are fed by the Reporting permission set, then data for Campaign, Ad Group,
and Ads require their respective read permissions.  

## Usage

You can easily run `tap-tiktok` by itself or in a pipeline using [Meltano](https://meltano.com/).

### Executing the Tap Directly

```bash
tap-tiktok --version
tap-tiktok --help
tap-tiktok --config CONFIG --discover > ./catalog.json
```

## Developer Resources

### Initialize your Development Environment

```bash
pipx install poetry
poetry install
```

### Create and Run Tests

Create tests within the `tap_tiktok/tests` subfolder and
  then run:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

You can also test the `tap-tiktok` CLI interface directly using `poetry run`:

```bash
poetry run tap-tiktok --help
```

### Testing with [Meltano](https://www.meltano.com)

_**Note:** This tap will work in any Singer environment and does not require Meltano.
Examples here are for convenience and to streamline end-to-end orchestration scenarios._

Your project comes with a custom `meltano.yml` project file already created. Open the `meltano.yml` and follow any _"TODO"_ items listed in
the file.

Next, install Meltano (if you haven't already) and any needed plugins:

```bash
# Install meltano
pipx install meltano
# Initialize meltano within this directory
cd tap-tiktok
meltano install
```

Now you can test and orchestrate using Meltano:

```bash
# Test invocation:
meltano invoke tap-tiktok --version
# OR run a test `elt` pipeline:
meltano elt tap-tiktok target-jsonl
```
